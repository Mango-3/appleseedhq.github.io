After more than five years of development and 23 alpha releases, we are proud to announce the immediate availability of appleseed 1.1.0-beta. Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/releases/tag/1.1.0-beta) for the full list of changes.

This release obviously represents an important milestone in the project, and paves the way to the first stable version of appleseed which we plan to release some time this year.

With this first beta out, we’re now starting a huge effort to document appleseed and make it more accessible to newcomers. The first results of this effort come in the form of the long due [Getting Started](/docs/gettingstarted.html) tutorial, as well as a growing number of [demo scenes](/download.html#demo-scenes) that demonstrate some of the features of appleseed.

This first beta version is accompanied by a completely new web site, easier to navigate and more pleasing to the eye. We hope you’ll like it.
