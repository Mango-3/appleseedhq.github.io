We are proud to announce the release of appleseed 1.2.0-beta, the second release of our beta program. Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/releases/tag/1.2.0-beta) for the full list of changes.

This release further improves our implementation of the OSL shading language, with support for ray differentials, bump mapping and background closures, amongst others. It also fixes dozen of bugs and adds many smaller "confort" features, both in appleseed itself and in appleseed.studio, our standalone lookdev application.

Please head over to our [Discourse forum](https://forum.appleseedhq.net/) for your feedback, questions and help requests.
