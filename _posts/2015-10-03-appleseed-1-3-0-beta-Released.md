We are proud to announce the immediate availability of appleseed 1.3.0-beta, the third release of our beta program (and the 26th release overall). Check out the [release notes](https://github.com/appleseedhq/appleseed/releases/tag/1.3.0-beta) for the full list of changes.

The major new feature of this release is a state-of-the-art implementation of raytraced subsurface scattering, as well as a number of diffusion profiles (the subsurface scattering equivalent of a BRDF):

* A simple Gaussian profile
* The Standard and "Better" Dipoles (for the "gummy" look common in animation)
* The newly published Directional Dipole
* And Pixar's new Normalized Diffusion profile for highly accurate subsurface scattering

Another important news is the return of appleseed on OS X (10.10 Yosemite and later), and the availability of appleseed in the [FreeBSD Ports Collection](http://www.freshports.org/graphics/appleseed/).

Finally, this release also fixes a number of bugs and adds a few other minor features.
